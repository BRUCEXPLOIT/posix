Hello everyone,
The source code for my POSIX shell, which was created entirely in Python, is available in this repository. 
The shell's functionality is currently being developed, but its goal is to support the essential POSIX capabilities.
In my Linux terminal, basic commands like "ls," "echo," and "type" are currently operational and have been tested successfully.

You are welcome to investigate, fork the repository, and add features, bugs, or enhancements to the functionality that already exists. We always appreciate and value your contributions.
